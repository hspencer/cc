> _This practice-oriented project asks: <br>**How can a generative pictographic system be designed to support communication for people with complex communication needs?**_


### RATIONALE

This research addresses a documented shortfall in current augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) systems, specifically their persistent inability to reconcile functional clarity with expressive identity for individuals with complex communication needs (CCN). Pictographic resources are predominantly shaped by clinical protocols and linguistic conventions, with minimal engagement from visual communication design (Boillos Pereira et al., 2019; Hall et al., 2021). Consequently, they exhibit low semantic transparency, stylistic inconsistency, and limited capacity for personalisation - constraints that restrict user agency, despite the centrality of these tools to daily communication and social participation. 

Contemporary legal and policy frameworks increasingly recognise cognitive accessibility as a human right. The Accessibility for New Zealanders Bill 153 (Accessibility for New Zealanders Bill, 2022), the Accessible Canada Act (Accessible Canada Act, 2023), and comparable international instruments affirm that equitable civic participation requires communication systems that are not only usable but also adaptable to individual expressive needs. Empirical research supports this stance, demonstrating that cognitive accessibility hinges on coherent, transparent mappings between lexical content and visual form (Bühler, 2021; Meloni et al., 2022) - a condition that is often unmet by most existing pictogram sets, which remain static, proprietary, and culturally homogenised. 

Generative technologies - particularly pipelines based on large language models (LLMs) - offer a novel material for design practice (Holmquist, 2017). Yet their current implementation in communication tools often reinforces opacity, treating AI as an autonomous black box rather than a configurable medium. This project proposes a deliberate shift: to reframe generative systems as transparent, editable design materials. By integrating reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and community-driven input, the research develops a federated, iterative framework for producing pictograms that are semantically rigorous, ethically grounded, and responsive to evolving user intent. 

The rationale is therefore twofold. First, it addresses a structural exclusion embedded in mainstream AAC design - one that privileges standardisation over self-expression and system efficiency over user sovereignty. Second, it repositions generative technology not as a replacement for human authorship, but as a scaffold for it. In doing so, the project aligns with emerging legal, ethical, and design imperatives that treat accessibility not as accommodation, but as co-creation. 

### SIGNIFICANCE

This research aims to make two interrelated contributions to design theory and practice by 
repositioning cognitive accessibility as both an epistemological and aesthetic concern. 

First, it proposes a conceptual reframing of accessibility as a fundamental design principle. Instead of viewing accessibility as accommodation for "special needs," the project places it at the heart of the meaning-making process. Cognitive accessibility is considered essential to the visual formation of knowledge, intention, and identity. Design is redefined beyond creating individual artefacts, but as seeding and building infrastructural conditions that support personal expression and shared interactions. This perspective broadens the scope of design to include the semantic and systemic layers that influence communicative potential, providing a theoretical framework in which accessibility is understood as a form of cultural participation. 

Second, the project seeks to offer a practical and technical contribution: PictoNet, an open-source, generative infrastructure for producing semantically grounded pictograms. PictoNet is built on PictoForge, an interface that supports round-trip authoring - a process where pictograms can be edited both as visual images and as structured SVG code, with changes in one view instantly reflected in the other (Figure 1). This bidirectional legibility allows practitioners and users to co-create, refine, and adapt pictograms with precise control over symbolic meaning and visual form. The proposed system incorporates reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and federated learning, enabling local communities to develop their own visual vocabularies while preserving semantic interoperability. Hosted openly on GitHub, PictoNet is envisioned to function as a pictographic commons: a dynamic, participatory resource that counters the opacity of proprietary generative models.

Together, these contributions aim to establish an aesthetic of accessibility, in which clarity, expressivity, and ethical agency are inseparable. The project seeks to demonstrate that generative technologies, when configured as transparent and editable design materials, can amplify user sovereignty. It offers a replicable model for inclusive design that bridges visual communication, human-computer interaction, and disability justice, with implications for civic and digital inclusion beyond augmentative and alternative communication.

## Contextual Review

This review situates the research across seven linked contexts: (1) philosophies of meaning (logical formalism; pragmatic contextualism); (2) multi-layered pictogram semantics in AAC; (3) socio-technical conditions shaping communication for CCN; (4) historical precedents in pictographic design; (5) the researcher's practice-oriented trajectory via PICTOS (Spencer González et al., 2023); (6) tensions between linguistic universals and cultural particularity; and (7) the infrastructural potential of generative AI as design material.

Positioned for adults and adolescents with CCN - including those with intellectual disability, autism, acquired or developmental speech impairment, limited literacy, and multilingual profiles - this study addresses contexts where conventional speech or text is insufficient and AAC provides vital channels for participation across education, health, and community settings (Beukelman & Light, 2020; Hall et al., 2021; United Nations, 2006). Visual supports in AAC increase semantic transparency and speed of recognition, a principle widely operationalised in public wayfinding where pictographic systems enable rapid comprehension in multicultural environments (Asociación Española de Normalización (UNE), 2022a; International Organisation for Standarisation, 2023). Pedagogically, the work aligns with special-education practice while incorporating Universal Design for Learning (Rose & Meyer, 2002). This approach promotes a variety of methods for representation, action, and engagement, making communication options accessible through design. The intended contribution is a generative, editable pictographic layer that can operate on standard devices, and support everyday transactions without bespoke peripherals (Booth, 2012; Light & McNaughton, 2012). This section examines how dominant AAC systems meet these demands and where their constraints motivate a generative alternative attuned to localisation, authorship, and semantic precision.

Analysis of three dominant AAC systems shows complementary limits. (1) Blissymbolics (BCI, 2025; Bliss, 1949) offers rule-based, compositional rigour, but its abstraction and steep learning curve hinder uptake beyond highly supported contexts (F. Cabello & Bertola, 2015; L. Cabello et al., 2018). (2) PECS and (3) Core Boards enable immediate function through concrete tokens or motor-memorised layouts, yet confine users to pre-authored vocabularies, restricting expression and authorship (Brydon, 2023; Pope et al., 2024). Neither reconciles semantic precision with user-led co-creation.

Interviews with AAC practitioners and pictogram designers, completed so far as part of this research, confirm this gap. Specialists emphasise that systems must be functionally transparent, localisable, aesthetically mature, and open to iterative refinement - qualities often absent from proprietary or static sets. This project proposes a generative pictographic system that integrates cognitive theory, visual semantics, and participatory infrastructure to produce editable, culturally responsive, and compositionally flexible pictograms.


### SYSTEMS THAT SHAPE COMMUNICATION

"Complex communication needs" (CCN) span intellectual disability, autism, acquired or developmental speech impairment, limited literacy, and multilingual contexts (Hall et al., 2021). The common feature is communicative asymmetry: a gap between intent and capacity, as conveyed through conventional language, that restricts interaction, education, healthcare, and civic life.
Cognitive accessibility enhances other forms of access (United Nations, 2006). Ramps or screen readers fail if instructions and interfaces remain linguistically opaque. It is not about simplification but about designing transparent, learnable, adaptable representations for diverse cognitive profiles - reframing accessibility as an epistemic and aesthetic dimension of design (Spencer González et al., 2020).
Autonomy is central to quality of life. Self-Determination and Causal Agency theories define it as intentional action and authorship (Adams et al., 2017; Wehmeyer et al., 2017a, 2017b). Fixed, pre-authored AAC vocabularies position users as recipients; systems that support customisation, revision, and expansion align with self-determination. Quality of life depends on having the means to articulate one's goals (Alonso, 2011; Urzúa M & Caqueo-Urízar, 2012; Verdugo et al., 2010).
Pictorial signs facilitate communication by allowing quick recognition of tangible referents, supporting the transition from objects to symbols, and can be organised into learnable patterns that reduce cognitive load (Blackstone et al., 2007; Kudo, 2022; Murphy et al., 1996). Legibility depends on precise composition; overload, stylistic inconsistency, or weak connections to lived experience diminish effectiveness (Erena Guardia et al., 2022). Users often shift from objects to photos to schematic pictograms, depending on the task, exposure, and context.
Concrete nouns benefit from iconic transparency; abstract ideas (e.g., I, think, because) need learnable conventions supported by pacing, feedback, and scaffolding. In neurodiverse settings, value is practical: enabling a specific action. The "ladder of abstraction" in AAC pedagogy reflects Dual Coding Theory, which posits that intuitive recognition is used for concrete terms, while rule-based decoding is employed for abstract ones (Paivio, 2013). Conceptual Integration Theory explains more complex blends - e.g., house + padlock → "safe home"; clock + finger-to-lips → "quiet time" (Fauconnier & Turner, 2008). For generative systems iconicity is enough for concrete nouns; stable, combinable conventions are essential for abstract primes.

### PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATIONS OF PICTOGRAPHIC MEANING 

This research engages two traditions for modelling meaning in symbolic systems: the Vienna Circle's logical formalism and Wittgenstein's later pragmatic contextualism.
The Vienna Circle (1924-1936) sought to remove metaphysical ambiguity by grounding discourse in empirical verification and formal logic (Uebel, 2020). Carnap's Logical Syntax (Carnap, 1934) proposed scientific languages built from syntactically precise, intersubjectively testable signs, with explicit formation and transformation rules. Here, meaning arises from internal syntax and inference rather than correspondence. This outlook informed AAC systems such as Blissymbolics, which treat pictograms as elements in a rule-governed visual calculus (Archer, 1977; Luftig & Bersani, 1985). 

Earlier rational symbolisms belong to a formalist tradition that sought to transcend the ambiguities of natural language. Leibniz's Characteristica Universalis envisioned a universal rational language grounded in a combinatorial calculus, supported by works such as De Arte Combinatoria (1666) and the New Essays on Human Understanding. This project aimed to construct an "alphabet of human thought" where reasoning could be reduced to calculation and meaning derived from systematic composition (Leibniz, 1989). Frege's Begriffsschrift (1879) continued this trajectory by establishing a two-dimensional logical notation intended as a universal concept script. His formal system provided a truth-functional, context-independent method for representing thought, marking a decisive moment in the development of symbolic logic and modern formal languages (Beaney & Reck, 2005). Across their differences, both figures exemplify the conviction that clarity rests on stable, rule-governed structures where meaning is abstracted from subjective or cultural variability.


![Figure 1](/public/images/img-01.png)
> _Figure 1. Compositional logic in Blissymbolics. In multi-character Bliss-words, a classifier is placed first to indicate the semantic domain (e.g. BUILDING, ANIMAL, FELINE). Subsequent symbols refine meaning through additive composition (e.g. BUILDING + MEDICINE = hospital; FELINE + STRIPE = tiger)._

While this system is internally consistent and rule-governed, its combinatorial method demands considerable abstraction and memorisation, which has historically limited accessibility for many users.
Blissymbolics implements this via a compositional lexicon of semantic primitives and fixed syntax (Figure 1). Its strength is systematicity; its weakness is uptake. Empirical studies indicate that users struggle with abstract combinatorics when lacking immediate context; rigid syntax often conflicts with natural communication, resulting in steep learning curves and limited cultural resonance (F. Cabello & Bertola, 2015).
Wittgenstein's later philosophy reverses emphasis. In Philosophical Investigations (1953), meaning is use within "language-games" embedded in forms of life (§7). A sign's significance is its role in routines. This meaning aligns with AAC literature: symbols succeed when integrated into interactional ecologies, not when conforming to universal logic (Beukelman & Light, 2020). Wittgenstein's earlier dictum - "the limits of my language mean the limits of my world" (1922, 5.6) - becomes material for AAC: absent tokens constrain expression.
This research locates visual communication design at the intersection of context-free and logical communication with iconic, tangible material representations. It adopts the Circle's demand for clarity, consistency, and auditability, implemented through editable SVG (W3C, 2018) structures and semantic primitives, while grounding these in pragmatic and situated use. Pictograms are context-sensitive, co-authored artefacts that evolve through interaction.

![Figure 2](/public/images/img-02.png)
> _Figure 2: Example of a pictogram as both code and image: the SVG markup on the left and the rendered icon on the right are two views of the same object. This dual form highlights the auditable and editable character of SVG, which makes pictograms accessible as semantic code, legible to non-specialists, and scalable without loss of quality._

Sign systems shape participation and pace interaction; they encode assumptions about legitimate communicators. Treating pictograms as living, editable artefacts redistributes authorship to users and communities (Illich et al., 1972) and aligns with the social model of disability, which locates barriers in environments (United Nations, 2006).

The project operationalises this via round-trip authoring (Hempel et al., 2019; Hempel & Chugh, 2016): reversible translation between natural language and structured SVG, with feedback that keeps representations legible while enabling refinement (Figure 2). Communities can contest, localise, and stabilise meanings over time.

This approach inherits Neurath's ISOTYPE principles (Neurath, 1936; Figure 3): images can carry conceptual structure, and visual grammar can be taught, reused, and recombined without loss of clarity (Burke, 2009; Groß, 2019). As Neurath noted, pictures cross linguistic limits.

The design outcome is intended to be a system that is logically rigorous where necessary, open to co-evolution, and oriented towards practical application. Semantic precision is pursued through iterative, situated use. The intention is for pictograms to function as both logical units, as described by Carnap, and pragmatic acts, as framed by Wittgenstein. 

### PICTOGRAMS IN AAC SYSTEMS 

In augmentative and alternative communication (AAC), pictograms serve as semantic infrastructures that mediate thought, identity, and participation, rather than generic neutral illustrations. Their design carries epistemic weight: line, colour, and composition encode assumptions about cognition, culture, and competence. For people with CCN, these choices are material conditions of expression (Beukelman & Light, 2020). 
A pictogram works across layers: referential (denoting "eat", "toilet", "happy"); pragmatic (supporting requesting, refusing, commenting in context) (Light & McNaughton, 2012); systemic (a visual grammar enabling or constraining combination); and cultural (reflecting or erasing lifeworlds) (Erena Guardia et al., 2022). Clarity is insufficient without semantic coherence. Concrete nouns benefit from iconic transparency; abstract terms (e.g., "because", "tomorrow", "fair") rely on learnable conventions. Without these, users remain unable to express causality, temporality, or moral stance (Kudo, 2022). 
Standards such as ISO 9186 assess comprehensibility of single icons (Asociación Española de Normalización (UNE), 2022b, 2022c, p. 2, 2022d, p. 3) but overlook composition - the visual syntax needed for phrases like "I want to go to the park tomorrow". High single-icon scores with weak syntax still restrict language access. Stylistic coherence, characterised by consistent abstraction, controlled detail, and unified stroke, reduces cognitive load. However, the mixed use of cartoon, photorealistic, and schematic styles creates noise. Many sets grew ad hoc and lack this discipline. 
Cultural appropriateness is essential. "House" should reflect local architecture; "food" must include relevant dishes; "family" must accommodate diverse kinship. Metaphors such as "teddy bear + cross" for paediatrics may mislead outside Western contexts (Zender & Cassedy, 2014). Integrations (e.g., te reo Māori, local foods) should be core, not add-ons.  Aesthetic maturity matters. Infantilising visuals can alienate adolescents and adults; respectful, restrained forms, on the other hand, support long-term identification (Ramirez, 2023).
Modularity enables expansion. Pictograms should act as compositional units. Conceptual Integration Theory explains blending "child" + "medicine" → "paediatrics"; "clock" + "finger to lips" → "quiet time" (Fauconnier & Turner, 2008). A generative system must support this.  The PICTOS project (Spencer González et al., 2023) operationalised a verb-object-context layered structure, mirroring language while remaining visually parseable; its dataset will train PictoNet, enforcing a coherent visual-semantic segmentation. 
Editability is critical. SVG affords labelled, styled, and modifiable elements, making pictograms auditable as both images and code (Figure 2). This redistributes authorship from corporations to communities (Illich et al., 1972) and aligns with the social model of disability (United Nations, 2006). Evaluation should be iterative and situated. High-frequency AAC phrases (Clarke & Bloch, 2013; Koul et al., 2005) offer a test bed, but final validation rests on user and professional judgment of communicative efficacy. 

### HISTORICAL PRECEDENTS IN PICTOGRAPHIC AAC 

Contemporary pictographic AAC draws on two mid-20th-century traditions: Otto Neurath's ISOTYPE and Charles K. Bliss's Semantography/Blissymbolics. Both treated visual representation as a structured, teachable system for conveying complex ideas across languages.

![Figure 3](/public/images/img-03.png)
> _Figure 3. Comparison of two graphic methods for representing quantitative data, as discussed by Otto Neurath in International Picture Language (ISOTYPE, 1936). Example A illustrates an ambiguous approach where figure size suggests proportional meaning, while B applies the ISOTYPE principle: each pictogram represents a fixed quantity, and numerical differences are expressed through repetition rather than scale._

ISOTYPE (1920s-30s) was devised for public education and democratic participation. Neurath rejected decorative ambiguity in favour of schematic, scalable graphics that communicate statistical and civic information to non-specialists (Neurath, 1936). His principle - that pictures can transcend linguistic limits - positioned visual language as a tool for social cohesion. ISOTYPE (Figure 3) demonstrated that images can encode conceptual relations, support composition, and be taught as a public skill, forming the foundations of information design (Burke, 2009; Groß, 2019).
Blissymbolics (post-WWII) proposed a universal auxiliary language built on logical semantics (Bliss, 1949). A limited set of semantic primitives (classifiers for objects, actions, and relations) composes complex propositions through agglutinative rules (Blissymbolics Communication International, 2025, Figure 1). Its strength lies in internal consistency; its appeal lies in its scalable handling of abstraction (Archer, 1977).
Empirical studies, however, report usability barriers: steep learning curves and weak links to everyday intentions limit independent uptake outside highly supported settings (Cabello & Bertola, 2015). When decoding costs exceed communicative benefit, logically elegant systems become inert.
Late-20th-century AAC shifted towards functional immediacy. Picture Communication Symbols (PCS) prioritised iconic recognisability over compositional logic and, through Boardmaker, became a de facto standard in schools and clinics (Johnson, 1987). The Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) utilised pictograms as tokens in structured exchanges, with a focus on requesting (Bondy & Frost, 2002). Studies indicate rapid progress - particularly among autistic children - although generalisation remains uneven and comparative data are limited (Pope et al., 2024).
A third approach, Core Boards (Figure 4), stabilises high-frequency vocabulary within fixed spatial arrangements. Implemented as LAMP, it associates meaning with consistent icon positions, harnessing motor memory through sequential pointing gestures (Mason, 2016; Naguib Bedwani et al., 2015). While this boosts speed and reliability, it can reduce pictograms to positional cues for users who rely on visually meaningful form-content relations. The design task is to integrate motor stability and visual semantics.

![Figure 4](/public/images/img-04.png)
> _Figure 4: A 77-cell communication Core Board, colour-coded using the Fitzgerald Key, complete with essential fringe vocabularies to support comprehensive communication as used in New Zealand._

These models address the same problem via different emphases: Bliss prioritises logical rigour but risks inaccessibility; PECS yields rapid function yet limits expression to available tokens; Core Boards privilege fluency through embodiment but may weaken semiotic richness. None fully resolves tensions among systematicity, learnability, and expressive range.
Current AAC ecologies reflect service structures as much as technology. In Aotearoa New Zealand, a contracted-provider model has normalised 77-cell core boards as a low-tech standard. TalkLink distributes boards widely, scaling partner-supported modelling; the Ministry's Inclusive Education portal embeds symbol boards within autism guidelines and parent-coaching (EP-AAC), reporting gains in initiation (Brydon, 2023). In Chile, policy emphasises curricular diversification, resulting in fragmented implementation: practitioners combine PECS derivatives and ARASAAC (Paolieri & Marful, 2018) under Decreto 83 (Gobierno de Chile, 2015), with stronger visibility in early childhood than in national pathways. Local adaptation is common - NZ teams adopt "core-plus-fringe" with bicultural extensions (e.g., te reo Māori). At the same time, Chilean educators mix visual schedules, photo boards, and exchanges shaped by training and procurement.
Both contexts highlight a significant gap: limited system-level data and underreported implementation details hinder cross-context learning. This emphasises the need for practice-focused research that documents not only which tools are used, but also how they can be adapted, localised, and maintained - precisely the gap this doctoral project aims to address. 

### FROM PICTOS TO PICTONET 

Building on my inclusive research background, which has centred on cognitive accessibility in public services and involved co-designing step-by-step transactional service supports for adults with intellectual disabilities, we developed PICTOS (Figure 5, Spencer González et al., 2023). These are pictographic and procedural supports that guide individuals sequentially through various tasks. Each pictogram, or support unit, comprises three layers: the verb, the object being interacted with, and the context or purpose. Since these supports are ultimately published by trained service providers, the process begins by prioritising plain-language text and then constructing the corresponding pictogram from this combination. 

![Figure 5](/public/images/img-05.png)
> _Figure 5. The structure of PICTOS. Services, which are enacted through venues, tasks, and step-based transactions. Each step is paired with a pictogram composed of action, element, and context, tightly coupled with its verbal instruction to enable completion of the process._

An initial step towards automation is to analyse the input text (instruction) and identify the optimal combination of layers (Spencer González et al., 2022) for the pictogram - a kind of smart default that the system could generate. The following technical question is whether the system can not only suggest but also generate the pictogram itself. This is the core question of the current research. 
To answer how a system can generate pictograms following a design logic, two cognitive theories are used: Dual Coding Theory (Paivio, 2013), which explains why pictograms work effectively at the intersection of verbal and non-verbal cognition, and Conceptual Integration Theory (Fauconnier & Turner, 2008), which explains how meaning arises from blending elements from different domains. 
Dual Coding Theory posits that human cognition processes verbal and nonverbal information through distinct yet interconnected representational systems (Paivio, 2013). The verbal system encodes linguistic input as sequential, symbolic propositions, while the non-verbal system processes sensory and imagistic input as holistic, analogue representations. This dual architecture explains why concrete concepts, such as "apple", "chair", or "water", are recognised rapidly through iconic visual pathways: their pictorial form closely resembles their physical referent, enabling immediate perceptual matching. In contrast, abstract concepts - such as "because", "tomorrow", "justice", or "hope" - lack direct visual correlates. Their comprehension depends on learned symbolic conventions, syntactic context, and relational inference. A robust pictographic system must therefore support both cognitive modes: it must maximise iconic transparency for concrete referents to reduce cognitive load, while implementing consistent, teachable visual grammars for abstract primes to enable systematic decoding. Without this duality, users remain confined to literal, transactional communication, unable to express causality, temporality, modality, or intentionality - core dimensions of human discourse. 
Conceptual Integration Theory provides a complementary framework for understanding how complex meaning is constructed from simpler elements (Fauconnier & Turner, 2008; 1995). The theory describes cognition as a process of blending inputs from multiple mental spaces - distinct conceptual domains, such as time, space, agency, or emotion - into a single, emergent structure. This blended space inherits selective properties from its inputs but also generates novel inferences absent in any source domain. In pictographic design, this manifests as the visual metaphor: a pictogram for travel planning may integrate a map (representing spatial navigation) with a pencil (representing annotation or intention), producing a new conceptual unit. Similarly, "safe home" might blend a house outline with a padlock, merging shelter and security into a single visual proposition. Designers perform this integration intuitively, drawing on cultural knowledge and contextual pragmatics. For algorithmic implementation, however, the process requires formalisation. PictoNet will be designed to operationalise blending through a structured pipeline that decomposes input phrases into semantic roles - verbs (actions), objects (targets), and contexts (frames) - and will map these to visual primitives via a curated visual dictionary. This dictionary must encode compositional rules: for instance, temporal modifiers may be rendered as clock faces, emotional states as facial expressions, and logical relations as spatial connectors.
PictoNet's generative logic will utilise Dual Coding Theory to distinguish concrete from abstract representations and will employ Conceptual Integration Theory to synthesise new visual meanings. The action - object-context structure of the training data offers flexibility for cultural variation while maintaining semantic coherence. These 'cognitive units' feed PictoNet's pipeline, enabling dynamic composition driven by context, user preference, and cultural specificity.

### UNIVERSALS AND PARTICULARS 

A persistent difficulty in the design of pictographic systems is how to balance cross-context intelligibility with the situated nature of communication. This tension mirrors the long-standing debate in linguistics and cognitive science between universalist and relativist positions. The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, formulated in the early twentieth century (Figure 6), suggested that the structure of a language influences the habitual thought of its speakers. While strong versions of linguistic determinism have been discredited, empirical studies continue to demonstrate more modest forms of linguistic relativity (Gilbert et al., 2006; Sapir, 1931; Whorf, 1940, 1956). 

![Figure 6](/public/images/img-06.png)
> _Figure 6. Illustration from "Language, Thought, and Reality: Selected Writings of Benjamin Lee Whorf", where he notes: Here are shown the different ways in which English and Nootka formulate the same event. The English sentence is divisible into subject and predicate; the Nootka sentence is not, yet it is complete and logical. The Nootka sentence is just one word, consisting of the root ti' imsh with five suffixes._

Studies on colour perception, spatial orientation, and object classification have shown that linguistic categories guide memory and categorisation, even if they do not determine perception (Brandt, 2013). Yet these claims are tempered by counterarguments from universalism: colour terms appear in predictable sequences across languages, and some perceptual biases seem to cut across cultural variation. 
Köhler illustrates this point (Figure 7). When shown a jagged shape and a rounded shape, most people, across cultures and languages, match "takete" to the sharp figure and "maluma" to the rounded one. This tendency suggests that humans share cross-modal correspondences between sound and visual form, undermining a purely relativist account of signification (Ramachandran & Hubbard, 2001).
In pictographic design, this effect demonstrates that specific formal properties such as sharpness, roundness, and density may have broadly universal semantic associations, even though specific metaphors or compositional strategies remain culturally dependent.

![Figure 7](/public/images/img-07.png)
> _Figure 7: The "Maluma-takete" effect (later renamed "Bouba-kiki") provides an example of cross-cultural visuality from a specific sound and visual synaesthesia (Köhler, 1929)._

A viable pictographic system must therefore be stable across contexts while remaining sensitive to personal histories and local cultures. The Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM) is introduced as a working hypothesis (Goddard & Wierzbicka, 2014; Michaelis, 2003) - this is an experimental component of this thesis, to be evaluated pragmatically through the quality of the pictographic output. Its constrained inventory of semantic primes, regarded as cognitively universal across languages (Wierzbicka, 1996, 1999). 
By shifting from verbal language to the visual domain, the NSM approach may offer a method for constructing pictographic units from semantically minimal components. Semantic explications serve as diagnostic tools for cross-linguistic meaning and act as design scaffolds for visual creation. Each explication is created through a structured breakdown that includes: (1) a gloss, expressed through semantic primes and irreducible paraphrases; (2) a frame, specifying communicative intention and situational context; and (3) a set of roles, which identify the participants or agents implied in the event structure. These attributes collectively inform the spatial arrangement and visual composition of the pictogram: the position, proximity, and prominence of pictorial elements can be derived from the internal logic of the explication. 
The NSM approach functions as both a linguistic heuristic and a visual layout strategy. Within the broader generative model - alongside Dual Coding Theory and Conceptual Integration Theory - NSM tokenisation offers a modular and interpretable layer that supports meaning composition while allowing visual variability and cultural adaptation. NSM stabilises what must be expressed through universal semantic operations - such as SOMEONE, WANT, and BECAUSE - while leaving the visualisation open to cultural adaptation.

### BRIDGING A GAP: DESIGNING A GENERATIVE COMMONS

Blissymbolics and PECS illustrate two different lessons about pictographic communication. The first shows the potential of a highly systematic grammar, capable of combining primitives into complex, even abstract, concepts. Its aim to go beyond the concrete makes it a valuable model of compositional rigour. At the same time, its ascetic abstraction and rigorous comprehensiveness result in a slow learning curve, which limits its practical use. PECS demonstrates the opposite: quick success in real-life exchanges through transparent, action-oriented pictograms. Its teaching approach reduces barriers and encourages early communicative agency. However, its scope remains narrow, restricting symbols to transactional routines and fostering an infantilised aesthetic that discourages adoption by adolescents or adults. Both traditions are valuable, but they leave an unaddressed gap: a generative model that treats semantic precision and graphic abstraction as continuous gradients, seeking a balanced measure across the latent space between word and image, and converging towards its most effective visual form.

Through the framework of Universal Design for Learning (UDL), the unaddressed gap becomes clearer. UDL outlines three guiding principles that serve as the foundation for accessing knowledge in a universally designed manner, without the need for additional supports.

According to Rose & Meyer (2002), these three principles are:

1. Multiple means of representation: This principle emphasises the importance of providing learners with multiple ways to represent and comprehend information, such as visual, auditory, and text-based representations.
2. Multiple means of action and expression: This principle emphasises providing learners with diverse opportunities for action and expression, including speech synthesis, text-to-voice pipelines, predictive typing, and eye-tracking interfaces.
3. Multiple means of engagement: This principle emphasises the importance of providing learners with multiple ways to engage with information, such as adaptive feedback, personalised interfaces, and other interactive elements.

Specifically, converting spoken or written language into pictograms remains a largely unresolved challenge, due to the semantic complexity of natural speech and the subtle contextual distinctions it encodes (Vandeghinste et al., 2017). PictoNet will be specifically designed to address this challenge. It is intended to operate as a generative engine for representation, producing structured SVG pictograms that are semantically traceable and visually transparent. Unlike comprehensive AAC frameworks such as Bliss, PECS, or Core Boards, which offer extensive repertoires and teaching methods, PictoNet intends to play a more focused role compared to a fully-fledged AAC system: providing infrastructural support that produces visual materials for other systems to adopt, validate, and expand. PictoNet will address this gap by treating pictographic representation as an evolving semiotic resource, situating communication within a space that is transparent in form and adaptable to context.


![Figure 8](/public/images/img-08.png)
> _Figure 8: PictoForge is an initial interface proposal for manipulating dynamically generated pictograms. The round-trip interface allows both visual and structural modifications by reciprocally changing the pictogram in either code or image form.

PictoForge (Figure 8) is an initial interface proposal that exemplifies where generated pictograms become tangible for communities: either retrieved from an existing dictionary or newly produced by PictoNet, then validated, refined, and stored for reuse. This interface belongs to a different sphere than the generative core. While PictoNet operates as an infrastructural engine, PictoForge is rooted in situated practices, shaped by local users, cultural references, and concrete communicative needs. At a higher level, the research also considers the infrastructure that connects these spaces (MediaFranca), enabling the insights and corrections made within local forges to inform and improve the shared generative model.
In this way, the doctoral investigation positions PictoNet as a missing infrastructural element within the broader AAC landscape. It operates as a generative engine that derives its value from connecting to local forges and community practices. Its presence enables new communicative scenarios: comments and reflections, questions and discoveries, meanings negotiated across diverse contexts. The gap is therefore both technical and conceptual. It signifies a horizon where pictograms transform from static assets into dynamic artefacts -mutable, situated, and open to collective redefinition.


## Design of the Study


This doctoral investigation utilises a practice-oriented methodology that combines mixed methods with speculative inquiry. The project has a bifurcated research approach: Situated Inquiry, which emphasises experiential and relational knowledge, and Formal Modelling, which concentrates on conceptual design and technical development. These two tracks encompass different threads of the research that develop concurrently within a double-diamond framework of divergence and convergence (Figure 9). 

Ethics approval to conduct expert interviews was obtained from the AUT Ethics Committee (AUTEC) on 8 April 2025 under reference number 25/44, for a three-year period. In parallel, the literature review, conceptual modelling, and initial technical prototyping were carried out during the first year.

This figure illustrates the research's two interwoven tracks - Situated Inquiry (relational) and Formal Modelling (ontological) - each following a double-diamond structure of divergent and convergent phases. The timeline marks key milestones: ethics approval (April 2025), current progress (October 2025), and the critical exegesis deadline (October 2027)._


### SITUATED INQUIRY

Situated inquiry is adopted as the primary qualitative methodology for examining how communication practices and design judgements emerge within everyday professional contexts. This research track aims to gather data from real-world professional practices, including educational and therapeutic settings, and design choices related to pictographic communication, which are arguably largely undocumented in the literature. It focuses on observing and eliciting practitioners' and designers' reasoning within their own environments, recognising knowledge as situated, embodied, and shaped by interaction (Kaptelinin & Nardi, 2009; Suchman, 2006). This approach contrasts with ethnography in that it is less immersive and temporally bounded, yet remains attentive to context and artefacts-in-use. It also differs from conventional user research, which often isolates tasks or measures performance. Within this thesis, situated inquiry integrates semi-structured interviews, artefact-based discussions, and field documentation to capture data on how AAC pictography is taught, adapted, and designed in practice.


#### Situated inquiry stages

The Situated Inquiry track unfolds through three consecutive phases, alternating divergence and convergence in line with the double-diamond model. The Discovery phase explores the territory of AAC and visual communication, examining its cognitive, relational, performative, and technical dimensions. The Conceptualisation phase identifies recurring patterns and derives transferable design principles from participants' experiences. The Prototyping phase returns to divergence, generating multiple representations and alternative configurations that translate the earlier insights into design form.

In the discovery phase, interviews will explore practitioners' perceptions of AAC systems, the adaptations and workarounds they employ, their criticisms of current methods, and their hopes for future tools. Designers will be asked to report and reflect on the cognitive processes behind their decisions when simplifying, combining, or stylising concepts. 

Two key groups of participants take part in the interviews. The first includes professionals such as speech therapists, teachers, and carers, who offer insights into how AAC pictograms are introduced, adapted, and maintained in everyday settings with people with CCN. The second group consists of designers working in fields like signage, accessibility, and emergency pictography, whose expertise lies in the processes of abstraction, synthesis, and visual evaluation. 

Ethical approval has been obtained to interview specialists in the field. To date, nine interviews have been conducted in Chile: two with experienced pictogram Designers, four with special-education teachers who regularly use AAC, and three with clinical psychologists specialised in AAC. Further interviews are planned in Aotearoa, New Zealand. Individuals with CNN or intellectual disability will not participate directly in this study as direct informants.

Conducted in person, the interviews allow the recognition of nuances in expression, gesture, and body language that are often integral to communication practices (Adeoye-Olatunde & Olenik, 2021). Sessions are made more productive when anchored in artefacts: practitioners are asked, during the interviews, to display and discuss their AAC tools, demonstrating specific scenarios, advantages, and limitations. Similarly, when interviewing designers, the discussion focuses on specific pictograms, inviting them to explain their reasoning, how they synthesise and integrate information graphically, and the principles they seek to uphold to maintain cognitive accessibility.

In the Conceptualisation phase, interview transcripts will be examined through thematic analysis, grouping and clustering recurrent topics to identify patterns across participants' experiences. The analysis will follow an Activity Theory approach (Kaptelinin & Nardi, 2009), framing artefacts as active mediators in communicative practices. This lens supports the interpretation of communicative intent through the dynamics of visual interaction, where pictograms and design conventions embody specific intentions and affordances. From these patterns, preliminary design implications will be derived as critical hypotheses to be tested and validated with research participants. These follow-up validation sessions will require further ethical approval, to be applied for in the first semester of 2026.

In the Prototyping phase, the conceptual findings will be translated into modular components that form the foundations of the generative pictogram model. Insights from practitioners and designers will be synthesised into cognitive and representational principles that define the model's operational logic. Diagrammatic representation serves as a design tool and documentation, enabling precise communication with software engineers to specify functional requirements and maintain transparency by recording the system's structure, workflows, and rules. All documentation is hosted in open-source GitHub repositories, enabling version control, peer review, and collaborative development. Through this open process, the prototyping phase will create a link between situated inquiry and formal modelling, ensuring that PictoNet's architecture remains understandable, traceable, and open to contribution.

### FORMAL MODELLING

In parallel, the second track focuses on developing PictoNet as a generative engine for creating structured, editable, and auditable SVG pictograms (Figure 8). The review phase refers to the multi-domain literature analysis conducted in this research, which has been discussed in the Literature Review section. The modelling phase involves designing potential interaction logics, visual grammars, and interface structures. The building phase will involve creating datasets and experimental prototypes, as well as training lightweight models to assess feasibility.

Designing with artificial intelligence fundamentally differs from traditional design methods. One does not create a language model itself but instead curates the initial dataset and determines the examples through which the model learns to approximate a desired outcome. This process involves a high degree of internal opacity, as the reasoning behind how neural networks produce results is not directly interpretable. This has led to the development of a whole field of research known as explainable AI, which focuses on safety, alignment, and interpretability (Bereska & Gavves, 2024).

Within this project, artificial intelligence is regarded as a design material - something that can be shaped, revised, and examined rather than an inaccessible or opaque backend. For AI to serve as a genuine material of design, it must remain open to interpretation and intervention, enabling its internal processes to be studied and reconfigured (Wang et al., 2025). The core of this formal modelling process is the translation of communicative intent, expressed in natural language, into pictograms that are understandable and culturally relevant. This approach adopts a modular understanding of large language models, breaking down their operation into interpretable components that reveal how input segmentation, linguistic reasoning, and visual synthesis interact. Such modularity, conceptualised as PictoNet's generative pipeline, enables designers and engineers to critically engage with the model's inner logic, transforming what might otherwise be a closed computational process into a site for collaborative design.

Comprehensive and accessible documentation is integral to this approach. All code, datasets, and visual grammars are systematically organised in open GitHub repositories (https://github.com/orgs/mediafranca/repositories), establishing a transparent framework for traceability, reproducibility, and peer review. This open infrastructure furthers rigour and accountability while encouraging collaboration among designers, technologists, therapists, and users, aligning their contributions within a coherent and evolving design process.

At the technical level, the project develops through an adaptive pipeline that remains open and iterative rather than fixed. The pipeline progresses in modules, with each component tested, refined, and combined in successive stages. Early experiments have concentrated on training models capable of reproducing a consistent visual style derived from the PICTOS corpus; these models currently generate raster images rather than vector-based SVGs. Future iterations will progressively incorporate additional theoretical elements - Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM), Dual Coding Theory (which suggests parallel verbal-visual processing), and Conceptual Integration Theory (introducing iterative loops of metaphor revision) - to approximate the desired pictographic output. Consequently, the pipeline functions as a living system where design hypotheses are continuously tested and reconfigured. A key design criterion is computational accessibility: the model must remain lightweight enough to operate on standard local hardware (up to 16 GB RAM), enabling broad participation and equitable use.

The final stage within the Formal Modelling track focuses on evaluating the model's internal coherence and generative performance before the two research tracks converge. This evaluation addresses both computational and design dimensions. At the computational level, each module of the pipeline - data selection, reasoning, and visual synthesis - will be assessed for stability, efficiency, and scalability, ensuring that the system remains lightweight and feasible on standard hardware. At the design level, outputs will be examined for graphic consistency, semantic transparency, and cultural suitability, aligning with principles derived from the Situated Inquiry track.

Central to this evaluative process is the Visual Communicability and Semantic Correspondence Index (https://github.com/mediafranca/VCSCI), designed specifically for this project. The VCSCI comprises a curated set of foundational phrases representing core communicative intentions in AAC systems. These phrases produce a benchmark set of pictograms against which model outputs are compared. The index is embedded within PictoForge, a dialogical interface through which users can visualise the model's internal reasoning, examine intermediary artefacts, and audit how natural-language intentions are converted to pictographic forms. Users may correct generated pictograms, reintroducing them to the system to reinforce semantic alignment with local audiences and refine the training corpus.

Validation in this phase combines automated and human-in-the-loop methods. Synthetic benchmarks will test reproducibility and style consistency, while expert reviewers and users will engage via PictoForge to edit, rate, and tag outputs. This interaction forms a recursive feedback loop: human input guides retraining, new outputs are reassessed, and the system evolves not as a sealed algorithm but a transparent, auditable, and collaboratively co-designed artefact.

### FINAL CONVERGENCE

Both tracks operate reciprocally and concomitantly: insights from practitioners and designers inform the formal rules of pictogram creation, while prototypes and outputs are returned to participants for critique and refinement. This cycle is implemented through PictoForge, the local interface that enables users to retrieve pictograms from a shared dictionary or generate new options through PictoNet, which can then be validated, corrected, and stored. In this way, PictoForge anchors the generative model in situated practice, while the broader infrastructure will consider local adaptations as assets for shaping the progressive refinement of the generative engine.

In the final phase - Evaluate, Engage, Reflect - the two research tracks converge in the concluding part of the double diamond (Figure 9). This stage involves re-engaging the participants previously interviewed during the Situated Inquiry phase, including speech-language therapists, psychologists, educators, and pictogram designers who have expressed interest in following the project's development in the final round of feedback. Interaction will take place through dedicated web interfaces of PictoForge, deployed in local implementations that suit specific communities and linguistic or cultural contexts - such as an accessible classroom for Chile and another for New Zealand, or a Latin-American version focused on in-house activities for dementia and ageing. These distributed environments make participation seamless while collecting data that mirror local communicative priorities.

In the final phase, participants will interact with the system via a round-trip interface, where pictograms created from text prompts can be reviewed, rated, and corrected. The platform incorporates the Visual Communicability and Semantic Correspondence Index (VCSCI), a quantitative and qualitative framework designed to evaluate the clarity, communicative effectiveness, and semantic accuracy of generated pictograms. Each VCSCI entry represents a basic communicative phrase within Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) systems, establishing a consistent benchmark for assessing model quality across multiple iterations. This iterative process constitutes the model's refinement stage, progressively converging towards the first official release of PictoNet, planned for October, 2027. Through this interface, participants can visualise the model's reasoning process, see how linguistic meaning is mapped onto pictorial representations, and examine its semantic alignment. Once corrected, these pictograms are reintegrated into the next training dataset, enhancing the model's correspondence with real-world communicative needs.

The data collected in this phase are varied - comprising re-labelled images, numeric ratings, and contextual annotations - but will serve the same purpose: informing the next iteration of the generative model. This method enables a design-research cycle where human evaluation and machine learning develop together, improving both the artefacts and the processes that create them.

From a technical perspective, this iterative retraining employs emerging optimisation techniques such as Unsloth (Le et al., 2025), which maintain local data stacks to enhance precision within each implementation of PictoForge. These local refinements coexist with the broader goal of federated learning, enforcing that improvements achieved within specific contexts contribute to a shared, global model. The resulting tension between local precision and universal communicability defines the critical focus of this phase.

### DESIGNING A GENERATIVE COMMONS 

Interaction design is closely connected to the technological foundation of its era. Because it shapes how humans and technologies interact, the field requires continuous adaptation to remain responsive within rapidly changing technological environments (Wakkary & Oogjes, 2024). The recent rise of generative artificial intelligence, especially transformer-based large language models, has not yet been fully adopted as a design material. Design research has generally approached AI conceptually rather than materially, resulting in visions that are often impossible to implement within existing technical infrastructures (Yildirim et al., 2023). 
This project treats generative AI as a design material. It does not seek to advance the frontiers of artificial intelligence research. Instead, it aims to arrange known components into a new configuration, mapping the cognitive steps of pictogram creation - semantic classification, tokenisation, dual coding, conceptual integration, and SVG templating - onto well-established machine-learning techniques, each supported by specialised models with proven reliability (Steidl et al., 2023). This approach operationalises the designer's intellectual labour as a modular pipeline. Each stage is intended to be tractable, reversible, and open to user feedback, allowing the system to be edited at both the code and image levels. 
The generative system is envisioned to become a commons: a shared infrastructure where pictograms exist simultaneously as visual artefacts and as structured, inspectable code (Figure 2). SVG outputs include semantically labelled nodes, graphic styles CSS (W3C, 2024, 2025) and normative presets, making pictograms auditable both visually and syntactically. This dual status supports accountability and is intended to enable communities to contest, localise, and stabilise meanings over time. 
Undertaking this technical journey will make a methodological contribution to practice-oriented design research. By documenting how generative AI can be configured as design material, the project aims to contribute a new framework for design inquiry through practice (Candy & Edmonds, 2018). It seeks to demonstrate how technical experimentation, when aligned with cognitive accessibility and communicative pragmatics, can extend design from discrete artefacts into the infrastructural systems that sustain them. 
The research unfolds across three interdependent layers (Figure 10). 

![Figure 10](/public/images/img-10.png)
> _Figure 10. Three-tier speculation in practice-oriented design research: visual communication design (PictoNet), interaction design (PictoForge), and systems design (MediaFranca)._

The first, PictoNet, is the generative pictographic model. It produces context-sensitive pictograms by blending cognitive principles with compositional rules, using the semantically layered PICTOS dataset as its initial training corpus. 
The second layer, PictoForge, gives PictoNet a practical interface. It enables users, researchers, and practitioners to generate, inspect, modify, and retrain pictograms. The interface implements round-trip authoring: changes to the SVG code update the visual rendering, and edits to the image adjust the underlying structure. This bidirectional legibility supports iterative refinement driven by real communicative needs, not abstract optimisation metrics. PictoForge facilitates the creation of synthetic datasets, assessment of outputs, and retraining of the model for ongoing enhancement. 
The third layer, MediaFranca, is a speculative proposition for a federated pictographic commons: a decentralised, community-governed infrastructure for sharing and co-evolving visual vocabularies while preserving local autonomy and semantic interoperability (Murturi, Donta, & Dustdar, 2023).
It explores how generated pictograms might circulate, adapt, and evolve across professional and community settings. Governance would be distributed, with local groups maintaining cultural and linguistic sovereignty over their visual vocabularies while contributing to a shared semantic framework. Open repositories, peer-reviewed validation, and community curation would ensure quality without imposing uniformity (Murturi et al., 2023). The aim is a system that respects local specificity, promotes technological autonomy, and enables mutual legibility across diverse communicative contexts. 
This recursive alignment between personal adaptation and collective cohesion defines the project's horizon. PictoNet is not a final product, but a seed for a generative commons  - one that redistributes authorship, embeds accountability, and expands the communicative horizon for people with complex communication needs.
